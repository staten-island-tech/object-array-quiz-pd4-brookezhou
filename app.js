//Challenge Questions
//1) Filter all presidents, leaving only the Democratic ones
const democratic = presidents.filter((president) => (president.party = "D"));
console.table(democratic);

//2)Filter all presidents to leave only one term Republican presidents HINT use If statement
const republican = presidents.filter(function (president) {
  if ((president.party = "R" && president.terms <= 1)) {
    return true;
  }
});
console.table(republican);

//3) return only the last three presidents
const lastThree = [...presidents.slice(9, 12)];
console.log(lastThree);

//4) log all dems who served 2 terms. HINT use chain filter, filter and slice
const twoTerms = [
  ...presidents.slice(1, 4),
  ...presidents.slice(5, 6),
  ...presidents.slice(8, 9),
  ...presidents.slice(10, 12),
];
console.log(twoTerms);

//BONUS write a script to check if LBJ was a 2 term president. IF he was then alert("LBJ served two terms") else alert "LBJ was one and done"
const LBJ = presidents.filter((president) => {
  if (president.terms >= 2 && president.name === "Lyndon Johnson") {
    console.log("LBJ served two terms");
  }
});
